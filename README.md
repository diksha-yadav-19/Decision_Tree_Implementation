# Decision Tree Implementation

A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure used for decision-making and data classification. In this tree structure, each internal node represents a feature (or attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

The **root node** is the topmost node of the decision tree, and it starts the process of partitioning the dataset based on attribute values. This process, known as **recursive partitioning**, continues until the data is sufficiently partitioned. Decision trees are easy to interpret and mimic human decision-making, making them valuable in various applications.

## How Does the Decision Tree Algorithm Work?

The core concept behind any decision tree algorithm is as follows:

1. **Select the Best Attribute**: Use an Attribute Selection Measure (ASM) to choose the most appropriate attribute for splitting the dataset. Common ASMs include:
   - **Information Gain**
   - **Gini Index**
   - **Gain Ratio**

2. **Split the Dataset**: Make the selected attribute a decision node and split the dataset into smaller subsets based on this attribute's values.

3. **Recursively Build the Tree**: Repeat the process of selecting attributes and splitting the dataset for each child node. This recursion continues until one of the following conditions is met:
   - All records in the subset belong to the same class.
   - There are no more attributes left to split on.
   - There are no more records to split (i.e., the subset is empty).

Below is a flowchart that illustrates the approach:
